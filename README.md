Developed a simple laravel project using MySql as database for learning experience. 

Uses blade template, and uses laravel Auth for registration and login purposes for 2 different user levels. 
Uses middleware to validate access to certain routes. 

The system uses Laravel, MySql, and Eloquent for data acccess. 

System is quite straightforward but is a useful experience in helping to understand the Laravel framework.
